# Visualizing of U.S. retail sales information by Tableau

In this project, I'm showing data visualization of U.S. retail sales information by Tableau with interactive dashboard. I'm using dataset from **[Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/claudiojnior/u-s-retail-dataset)**

A dashboard consists of table of sales value per year, sales by product type and sales by state with geographic.
